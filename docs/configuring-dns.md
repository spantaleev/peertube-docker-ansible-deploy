# Configuring your DNS server

To set up PeerTube on your domain, you'd need to do some DNS configuration.

You need to point your PeerTube hostname (subdomain or top-level domain, as defined in the `peertube_hostname` configuration variable) to your PeerTube server's IP address.

When you're done configuring DNS, proceed to [Configuring the playbook](configuring-playbook.md).
